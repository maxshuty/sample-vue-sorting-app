# pizza-toppings

Filtering the top 20 ordered toppings. This app is responsive.

This project has many TODO's in it that ultimately would need further cleaning up if this were a real world application.

This was simply an attempt to filter and sort pizza toppings but more so a sample project to play with some fun technologies.

Finally this has no polyfils for older browser support. If you find something in here and decide to use it please note that you should add some polyfills for extra browser support. I recommend this great resource: https://polyfill.io/v3/
